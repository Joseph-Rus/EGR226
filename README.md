## üîé How It Works

The application combines multiple detection techniques:

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Machine Learning** | Uses TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes classification |
| **URL Analysis** | Examines links for suspicious characteristics |
| **Form Detection** | Identifies potential credential harvesting forms |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Detects common phishing and spam patterns |
| **Domain Verification** | Checks if linked domains actually exist |

## üîß Technical Details

- Built with Python and tkinter for cross-platform compatibility
- Uses scikit-learn for machine learning components
- Implements multithreading for responsive UI during model training
- Persists trained models for reuse across sessions
- Includes example datasets for immediate use
